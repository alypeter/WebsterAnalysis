It has been controverted whether Moses borrowed his system of pu|rification from the institutions which he found in Egypt; or whether the Egyptians borrowed the idea from the laws of Moses. Nothing can be more idle than such a dispute. The experience of men would very readily suggest the necessity and utility of great cleanliness, to preserve health in the climate of Egypt. The custom of circumcision was established among the Egyptians, as well as among the Israelites; and Herodotus who visited Egypt to collect facts, expressly declares that the "Egyptians circumcised their children for the sake of clean|liness." —There is not the least reason to suppose that the Egyptians borrowed this custom, or others respecting cleanliness, from the Israel|ites. Nor does it vary the question, that the laws of Moses were the commands of God. Divine commands have rarely introduced a new principle of right and wrong. Most of them are injunctions on man to conform to principles of moral fitness or utility, which existed an|terior to the commands. They unfold to human view, and enforce the prac|tice of those principles; but do not create them. They add the strong authority of positive, to the feebler authority of implied divine will; and are thus of the highest importance to mankind.

This evidently alludes to the received opinion among the ancients, that comets have an influence in producing pestilence. In the course of this work, we shall have some grounds to determin which is most correct, this opinion of antiquity, or that of the moderns who hold it in contempt.

It is to be observed that the idea of comets producing diseases, is not in Homer, in the passage from which these lines are taken, but is a licence of the translator, Mr. Pope, and the sense and almost the words, are borrowed from Milton. Book 2. l. 710.

"—And like a comet burn'd
In th' arctic sky, and from his horrid hair,
Shakes pestilence and war."
It is certain however that the ancients believed comets to be the cause of pestilential diseases.

It is further remarkable that, in the pestilential period to which Ho|mer here alludes, which happened during the siege of Troy, Etna was in a state of eruption; or rather at the close of the period: For Eneas, when driven from Troy, sailed with his fellow citizens to Sicily, but was frightened away by a violent explosion of Etna. See a forcible de|scription of this eruption in Virgil lib. 3.

Dyonisius Hallicarnassus informs us that the Pelasgi, who settled in Sicily, soon after the Trojan war, were affected with pestilence. Book 1.

This account seems to contradict the doctrin of a progression in the pestilential principle. Thucydides remarks also that the plague inva|ded Athens suddenly. Such is the effect of superficial observation. So in 1794, the people of New-York alledged the city to be very heal|thy; when in fact the bill of mortality was higher by one fourth than usual. So the invasion of New-London by the fever in 1798 appeared to be sudden; altho in fact the bills of mortality show a most sensible increase in the force of the destructive principle, two years previously to the attack.

In the epitome of the 46th book of Livy, which book is among those which are lost, I find it related that the Pontine Marshes were drained or dyked [siccatae] and converted into cultivable land, by the Consul Cornelius Cethegus, about the year of Rome 572. The Ro|mans were convinced that the marshes were very unwholesome, and they took incredible pains to render their city and territory healthful, by draining off all stagnant waters.

It is much to be regretted that we have not this book of Livy, to give us further information in what manner the draining of the marshes was effected. It is considered by the moderns as impracticable.

The opinion of the ancients as to the unhealthfulness of Rome may be understood from the following Tetrastichon, which is preserved by Baronius.

"Roma vorax hominum, domat ardua colla virorum;
Roma ferax febrium, necis est uberrima frugum;
Romanae febres stabili sunt jure fideles;
Quem semel invadunt, vix a viventi recedent."
The brief translation of which is "Rome subdues men by the sword, and kills them with fevers."

Horace book 2. ode 29. gives to the Tyber, the epithet udus, wet or marshy.

We are sometimes embarrassed with the differences in the chro|nology of different authors. But we have, in this place, data that will fix certain points.

From the uniform operations of nature, there can be very little doubt, that all the great events of the physical world, in this period, happened within twelve or eighteen months of each other. The ex|treme drouth in Italy and Greece, mentioned by Livy and Thucydi|des, unquestionably occurred, at both places, in the same year. Livy places this under the consulship of A. Cornelius Cossus and T. Quincti|us Pennus, which Hook arranges under the 325th year of Rome, and Lempriere, under the 327th.

Now Thucydides expressly relates, that the great earthquake which injured Athens, and produced the inundations in the Corinthian Gulf and the Sea of Euboea, rending Atalanta from the main land, and swallowing up a town in Euboea, happened in the spring or summer of the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war. This war commenced in the second or third year of the eighty-seventh Olympiad, corresponding with the years of Rome 323 or 324. The sixth year then will be the 328th or 329th year of Rome. These data bring the drouth in Rome to one of those years; at least they will not admit of its being placed earlier than the year 327, the year preceding the earthquake. It is probable therefore that Lempriere is right, in the arrangement of the consuls. This is rendered more probable, by the eruption of Etna, in the spring of the same year; as it is a known and common fact, that earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are preceded by exces|sive drouth; owing probably to a gradual increase of subterranean heat, or unusual electrical discharges and evaporation, some weeks, or months, before the explosion.

The comet undoubtedly appeared either in the year, preceding, du|ring or following the drouth; that is, in the year of Rome, 327, 328, or 329, corresponding with year before the Christian era, 427, 426, or 425. It was most probably in the year of the drouth, and in the fifth year of the war, A. U. C. 327, and B. C. 427; the earthquakes and volcanoe followed in the spring of the next year.

This ceremony consisted in placing the statues of Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury, and Neptune, on three beds, and serving them with magnificent repasts for eight days—a mode of checking the pestilence, about as rational as the modern scheme of confining it to the infected place by bodies of armed men, which is much praised by Montesquieu!

The incursions of the Picts and Scots had occasioned the neglect of culture and a famin; but this famin was fol|lowed by plentiful crops, which were succeeded by pestilence.

I have found no author that mentions a comet about this time; but it is worthy of remark that the splendid comet of 1401 was calcu|lated to have a period of 343 years.

This has been observed in one or two instances in America, and has been alledged as an evidence that the influenza is an infectious dis|ease, and that persons sequestered from contagion, may escape it. To my mind the fact is rather an evidence that the escape of prisoners is owing to a different, perhaps a less stimulant condition of the air they breathe.

There is reason to believe, that salt, if not sufficient to preserve the article to which it is applied, renders it doubly noxious in a state of putrefaction; and that a small quantity of salt will accelerate the pro|cess of putrefaction. From an experiment related to me by Mr. Moses Brown of Providence, it is proved that a piece of flesh, in pure water, will not putrefy as soon as in water, in which a few grains of salt have been dissolved.

Do not the saline particles of the air, on the sea coast, render the putrefaction of flesh and vegetables more rapid, and the exhalations more deleterious, than perfectly fresh water? And is not this one cause, why pestilential diseases appear first, and are most general, in mari|time places?

Dr. Cogswell informs me that a boat-man on Connecticut river, in the hot weather of 1798, contracted a violent fever of which he died, by sleeping in an open boat, near a quantity of pickle which had leaked out of a barrel of salted provisions. The disease was of a very ma|lignant kind.

Modern philosophy objects to the popular sense in which the word, elements, is used; since it appears that what has usually been considered as an element, is found by modern chymistry to be a com|pound substance, resolvable into parts, in their nature and properties, distinct. Notwithstanding th•se discoveries, I cannot consent to discard the popular use of the word element. Nature presents to the senses of man, fire, earth, air and water, in a particular and predominant form. This is the form in which they appear to be most useful to man, and to be the constituent materials of other substances, as well as the agents in carrying on the great visible operations of the system.

It is not only during the appearance of comets, that their effects are perceived in the elements, but for many months before and after. I can testify from careful observations that the effects of that in August 1797, were very obvious, in anomalous tides, as early as the last week in May; and the inundations in England during the autumn and win|ter following, show its effects several months after its departure. The whole history of comets and their effects warrants this conclusion. Seneca made this remark seventeen centuries ago. These are his words.

"Aristoteles ait, cometas significare tempestatem et ventorum intem|perantiam atque imbrium.—Non statim cometes ortus ventos et pluvias minat•r, sed totum annum suspectum facit.—"Aristotle observes that comets indicate storms and violent winds and rain.—These effects how|ever do not immediately follow their appearance, but are to be expect|ed, during the whole year." He then mentions that such was the fact, with the comet predicted by Aristotle and Theophrasius, and which appeared in the consulship of Paterculus and Vapiscus. Nat. Quest. lib. 7.

I would further observe that comets move in trajectories of an elip|tical or parabolic form, the sun being situated in one of the foci. The time when we observe them is when they pass this part of the ellipsis. Now according to the universal law of planets, by which they describe equal area• in equal times, their motion must be most rapid when near|est the sun, and within our sight. Before their appearance, and after their departure, their movement is slower, than when within the so|lar system, and they may be near the earth, many months before they enter the system or become visible. Hence their influence on the earth so long before and after their appearance.

It is further to be observed that many comets doubtless enter the sys|tem and pass round the sun without ever being seen, and such as come from regions of space directly opposite to the earth, must be invisible, unless we can see them in the splendor of the sun's rays. This re|mark is as old as Seneca and older. He relates an instance, in which Posidonious discovered a comet, in the darkness of a solar eclipse, which would not have been seen, had not the eclipse happened. Lib. 7. sect. 20.

Newton and Halley have made the same remark. Hence perhaps we may account for violent seasons, like the severe winter of 1780, which happened without the appearance of any comet. This is mere con|jecture.

Is not this swelling of the ocean, previous to an earthquake, anal|agous to the tides? May not both be ascribed to the force of electricity; the swell of the water preceding earthquakes being irregular, as depend|ing on no regular visible cause; and the tides being more regular, as be|ing the effect of the moon's influence on the electrical principle. This idea seems to derive some strength from the known fact that earthquakes usually happen in periods of the moon's revolution, when that orb ex|erts its greatest influence on the earth. From numerous calculations, it appears that earthquakes usually occur near the moon's perigee or apogee or the change or conjunction of sun and moon; generally about three days before or after the conjunction—this, by the way, is the very time when epidemic diseases usually invade the patient, or come to fatal termination, according to the remarks of all modern physicians —a singular fact that may lead to important conclusions.

In a few instances, earthquakes happen near the full moon—the oth|er position in which that satellite exerts more than her ordinary influ|ence on the earth.

Let these facts be compared with the occurrence of violent tempests about the same time of the moon's revolution, the invasion of epidemic diseases and the full tides.

A strong confirmation of this opinion is derived from the swelling of the sea, just before a hurricane in the West-Indies. There is a visi|ble intumescence, before the atmosphere is clouded, or the least breeze o• wind. What can be the cause, but the electrical fluid which is pass|ing 〈◊〉 the earth to the atmosphere, and is speedily to produce most tr••ous effects. See the Addenda.

It is a most extraordinary circumstance that the British authors, in modern days, should all agree that a favorable constitution of air is ne|cessary to propagate the plague, and yet that no plague is bred in north|ern climates. They must admit and do admit, that such a favorable state of air has often existed in all parts of Europe; this is a kind of half way business; allowing northern climates the power of creating and preparing a condition of atmosphere that shall meet the plague half-way.

But will it be denied that the petechial fever and angina maligna originate in northern latitudes? I presume not. Then the condition of air is admitted to produce most deadly infectious diseases, but not the most deadly of all. Kind heaven, in mercy to the northern world, has permitted the elements to generate diseases almost as bad as the plague, but not quite.

I then ask, does not the production of the angina maligna suppose as deleterious a principle in the air, as that of the plague? Is not the disease as fatal to youth, and more certainly infectious or contagious? This cannot be denied. That disease sometimes destroys as great a pro|portion of patients seized as the plague, and is more certainly conta|gious to youth? Besides this distemper depends not on local causes, but wholly on a condition of the elements; it therefore implies a most essen|tial alteration in the atmosphere.

Further, if petechial fever is generated in northern climates, it de|monstrates the power of those climates to produce the plague; for it has been proved, that this fever is the same species of disease, and of|tens turns to the plague. It has done this, very often in England and on the Baltic.

Infection spreads certain diseases, and ought to be avoided; but med|ical men have ascribed ten times more effects to that cause, than it ever produced. The same principle which generates the angina maligna or plague, in one instance, must be competent to produce it in all other persons of like disposition and habits.

Warm southerly rains however high the wind, usually increase the violence of the disease, by inducing debility and giving activity to the local causes, as noxious effluvia from vegetable substances. Cool north|erly winds, accompanied with heavy rains, lessen the morbid action of the pestilential principle; and if late in the season, and not succeeded by very warm weather, may entirely remove it. A violent tornado, with great rain, on the 8th of October 1797, was supposed to put a step to the pestilential fever in Providence. Water decomposes the poi|son, or incorporates it into its own mass—but h••t after moisture occa|sions a more rapid decomposition of vegetables and increase the poison.

Medical men are not agreed, as to the nature of what is called pre|disposition. Brown, in Elements of Medicin, defines it to be a less degree of the disease; that is, the commencement of the disease. I suspect this definition, properly limited, to be nearly just. It is probable that all fevers are the effects of debility, and that when this debility com|mences, a person may be said to be predisposed to disease; altho the disease may not be formed in many days or weeks after, or may be prevented by early applications.

A curious fact is related to me by Dr. Dutton of Oxford, in Der|by. In the year 1795, almost every male child, born in the beginning of the year, in that and the adjacent towns, died within a fortnight by convulsions, but no female child was affected. This was observed to be more frequent in families that had been affected by the scarlatina, in the preceding year.

The advocates of the specific contagion of the plague do not ad|mit that the true plague ever appears in sporadic cases. They think, if it once appears, its contagion must of necessity, spread it. This is all a whim. I believe, with Dr. Mitchell, that any disease of the worst type, may be generated in the body, solely by a derangement of the functions of the stomach and intestines, and the poisonous air extricated from food. But that sporadic cases of plague may occur and do occur very often, I have not the least doubt. During the late war, in 1776 or 1777, two brothers by the name of — arrived from the army at Greenwich in Connecticut—one had a malignant fever, with glandular tumors; the other was his nurse and in good health. The sick man di|ed soon after he arrived, and in less than 24 hours, his brother was also in his grave. This was true plague; but no other attendant was in|fected.—

Savary remarks "that the plague seldom reaches the polar circle and never passes the tropics. The caravans of Cairo, Damascus and Ispahan, which are sometimes infected, never propagate it at Mecea, and Yemen is safe from the plague." With few exceptions these observations are just. If the natives of cool regions pass suddenly into tropical cli|mates, they are subject to violent fevers; but the reason assigned in the text is sufficient to account for the perpetual exemption of natives of hot climates from the worst form of pestilence. Their bodies mould them|selves to the climate—their excitement or debility is always uniform. it is the great changes, in these respects, which expose people in the middle latitudes to the attacks of pestilential diseases.

Yet this was the most violent and destructive form of the plague that ever has been known.

I take this opportunity, in discussing the question concerning the origin of heat, to notice what philosophers have said on the subject of the internal heat of the earth. Darwin, in his Botanic Garden, note 6, alleges the earth below the depth of about ten feet, to be always of the same temperature, which is 48 deg. by Farenheit. He cites Dr. Franklin's observation, that spring water at Philadelphia is of 52 de|grees, which, he supposes, a proof of internal heat from central fires. For as the climate of North-America is colder, than that of England, he could not account for the excess of heat in the water at Philadel|phia, beyond that of England •t by presuming it to be occasioned by internal fires. Yet in another passage, in note 7, the author intimates that he had an idea of a difference of heat in different latitudes, deri|ved from the action of the solar rays. Yet I cannot find any European author who appears to have had a correct idea of this subject; and Mr. Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, query 5, has manifested his ignorance of it, by a most egregious mistake. Speaking of a cave in Frederick county, he informs, that the thermometer, which stood at 50 deg. in the open air, rose to 57 deg. in the cave. He then adds the following remark, "The uniform temperature of the cellars of the Observatory of Paris, which are 90 feet deep, and of all subterranean cavities of any depth, where no chymical agents may be supposed to produce a factitious heat, has been found to be 10 deg. of Reaumer, equal to 54½ of Farenheit. The temperature of the cave above men|tioned so nearly corresponds with this, that the difference may be as|cribed to a difference of instruments."

It seems a little strange that so gross an error should have passed un|corrected, till this late age, on a point of fact so easy to be ascertained.

The truth is, the temperature of the earth, below the diurnal and annual influence of the solar rays, which may be perhaps ten feet in solid earth and 30 feet in open wells, is regulated by the proximity of place to the equator, subject to small variations, from the position of the place in regard to the ocean and the height of the land.

But what is remarkable, this temperature of the earth and water in the anterior of the globe, is precisely the mean temperature of the climate, in the place where the observation is made. Thus, let the highest and lowest points be taken daily by any good instrument, and divide the sum of all the observations by the number of days in the year, the quotient will be the mean temperature of the climate, and precisely the temperature of the water, below the variations of heat and cold. If any difference should be found, it must be owing to inaccuracy in the observations. It is more usual to take three observations daily; at 2 o'clock P. M. the warmest time in the day, at sun-rise the coldest time, and at sun-set, which is found to be the mean temperature. By observations made in the city of New-York for one year, I found the mean temperature to be 53½; but this is 1½ degree too high; owing to an excess of heat within the city, beyond the general temperature of the climate. The air in a city cools less at night, than in the country, and hence the morning observations were found to be too high. In many instances, ice as thick as glass was formed a mile from New-York, when an accurate thermometer in the city fell no lower than 40 deg. Hence the great error of determining the temperature of a climate, by obser|vations made in a large city; which is often done in Europe.

The mean temperature of the climate in England, is 48 deg. That of Paris, 54½. This difference is owing to the insular situation of England; the atmosphere in the vicinity of large tracts of water being always more temperate, than on continents at a distance from the sea or great lakes.

The following is the mean temperature of the climate of the re|spective places, ascertained by observations.

London, north latitude,	51°	30	temperature,	48°
Paris,	48	50	 	54½
Quebec,	46	48	 	42
Rutland, (Vermont,)	43	34	 	43½
Salem, (Massachusetts,)	42	30	 	47
Hartford, (Connecticut,)	41	44	 	49½
New-York,	40	42	 	52
Philadelphia,	39	56	 	52½
Virginia, (Frederick,)	39	nearly	 	57
Charleston, (S. C.)	32	44	 	66
Allowing a trisle for differences of instruments, this table presents to view the various mean temperatures of the climates mentioned.

From this table naturally arise two observations. First the great dif|ference between the climate in Europe and America, under the same parallels of latitude. Thus London in 51 degrees north, has a mean temperature, almost as mild as Hartford in 41, Paris in the 49th de|gree has a climate, nearly as mild as the northern parts of Virginia in the 39th, and warmer than New-York and Philadelphia in the 40th.

Again we observe the great effect of the ocean upon the climate. Salem in Massachusetts is upon the sea shore, and Rutland, in Ver|mont, fifty or sixty leagues distant; and one degree of latitude differ|ence in the position of the places; yet the climate at Rutland it 3½ degrees colder than at Salem. On the other hand, Quebec, remote from the sea, tho on a river, with three degrees difference of northern latitude, has a difference of only 1½ degree in climate.

To ascertain the mean temperature of any given place, it is only necessary to plunge a good thermometer into water, taken from a depth, in which the temperature it uniform, at all seasons of the year.

The mean temperature of water within the tropics it not exactly known, but it must be very near 80 deg. by Farenheit. Water drawn from a depth of 200 feet in the West-Indies, it cooled by filtration in the air, above the earth in those hot regions.

The difference in the temperature of Europe and America under the same parallels, is nearly that of ten degrees of latitude.

I mention the morbid matters from living bodies, among the causes of pestilence. I am persuaded that perspiration in cities furnishes more poison than streets and alleys.

A recess of this kind is •tioned in 1114, when the Thames for the whole day, on the 15th of October, was so low, that children wa|ded over between the Tower and London bridge. In 1247 there was a cessation of the flowing of the tides for three months, before a severe earthquake. See Short vol. 2. 145. I should not be inclined to credit these relations if modern observations did not serve to confirm them. On the 11th of March 1785 and 25th of January 1787, the Tiviat, a large river in the south of Scotland, receded and left its channel dry, in the former instance, two hours, and in the latter, four. No convulsion of the earth was known in that neighborhood, nor within two or three weeks of the first instance. As earthquake happened on the 26th of January, the day after the second instance, but could not be the cause. A similar recess happened on the day of the earthquake, in the river Clyde. On the 12th of September 1784, in perfectly calm weather, the water in the Lock Tay in Scotland suddenly ebbed 300 feet and left the channel dry, then flowed again, and thus alternately rose and fell for two hours. The same phenomenon, in a less degree, occur|red in several succeeding days.

Sinclair, vol 6. 624.
The facts related of the sea and rivers in Holland on the day, but not at the hour, of the earthquake, at Lisbon, in 1755, when ships snapped their cables, and water dashed over the sides of vessels, without the least sensible motion of the earth, are strong proofs of the same insensi|ble but immensely powerful action of the electricity of the globe. The swelling of the ocean in the time of earthquakes is not so much owing to the rising of the earth beneath, as to the force of electricity. The intumescence sometimes begins before the shock, as it does before hurri|canes in the West-Indies.

In Scotland, during the great earthquakes in Calabria, in 1782, the water in the locks was agitated without any motion of the earth, and the mercury in the barometer fell within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the scale. On the 12th of February 1787, the barometer at Edinburgh fell nearly to the same point.

These phenomena can be resolved into no cause but some operation of electricity, and they add much weight to my suspicions, that tides are governed by some laws of electricity, which are influenced by the phases of the moon.

The great fall of the barometer in Scotland is a strong evidence that the same energetic principle governs that instrument. It is absurd to suppose the atmosphere could have lost such a portion of its weight. Indeed it is far from being impossible that the rise and fall of the ba|rometer may be occasioned by the force of electricity acting on the qicksilver itself.

If any person should hesitate to believe that a mere change in the combination of electricity and aerial substances, may vary the spring or elasticity, without the least alteration of their weight, let him attend to the different powers of wine, cyder or beer, before and after fer|mentation begins. It is not presumable that the liquor has more weight in a state of fermentation, than when quiescent, before that process begins; yet the force with which it acts upon the cask con|taining it, is increased perhaps a hundred fold. I suspect that the changes in the atmosphere which affect the barometer and the human body are analogous to what we observe in liquors—mere alterations in the combinations of the parts, producing various elastic powers, with|out any change in the general gravity of the atmosphere. Hence it is easy to conceive that the elastic power of the atmosphere may be di|versified by substances exhaled from the earth, in different situations; this may occasion small variations of the barometer in two distant places, having the same altitude, and be one cause of differences in the salubrity of the air.

This idea it still better illustrated by the different properties of gun|powder in the kernel and in a state of explosion. In the former state, an immense elastic power is confined to a compass inconceivably small —by adding to it a spark of fire, this elastic power is set loose with tre|mendous effects.
